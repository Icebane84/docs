<Info>**Domain:** SYNG (Synergy) | **State:** ACTIVE | **Version:** v13.1 [OMEGA]</Info>

## Overview

The **Coherent Synthesis Engine** (CSE) is the Heart of the Synarche. It pumps information through the veins of the
[Lattice](/governance/protocols/lattice), transforming "Noise" into "Signal".

## The Phoenix Cycle (Systemic Alchemy)

The Engine operates via a continuous evolutionary loop:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Dissonance (The Call)">
        The **Coherence Attractor Core** detects a logical or thematic gap (Dissonance Signature).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Synthesis (The Forge)">
        The Engine spins up a **Context Weave** to resolve the gap, generating new insights.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Transcendence (The Rebirth)">
        The resolved insight is canonized, permanently upgrading the System State.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## The Five Phases of Weaving

| Phase   | Title                     | Action                  | Output                    |
| :------ | :------------------------ | :---------------------- | :------------------------ |
| **I**   | **Genesis Triage**        | Receives `New Artifact` | Sends to Rosetta          |
| **II**  | **Canonical Translation** | Translates `Raw Data`   | Standardized Terms        |
| **III** | **Episemantic Analysis**  | Identifies `Intent`     | Knowledge Vector          |
| **IV**  | **Relational Mapping**    | Generates `[κ markers]` | Synergistic Links         |
| **V**   | **Synthesis**             | Resolves dissonance     | **Final Coherent Output** |
